# Automated Schedule Entry

### The Story
Automated Schedule Entry (ASE) was created by college roomates, Patrick McInerney and Joseph Zepp, during their time at ASU. ASE was the brain child of Joseph, who was studying electrical engineering at the time. After developing the initial prototype Joseph asked his roomate, Patrick, a computer science major, for help polishing the program. Patrick was able to drastically reduce the program's runtime and solve many edge cases that had haunted the project. After months of late nights spent working on ASE and searching for potential buyers the two were given the opprotunity to present the project to one of the larest electrical contractors in the United States. A few weeks and an 8 hour drive through a snow storm later, and the two had arrived at a hotel near their potential client's site. The next day, while going over their presentation the two came to a conclusion, the program could be better! So they got to work. After a near 20 hour working session the two had completely rewritten core of the program with a few hours to spare. Joseph, who would be giving the demonstration, had fallen asleep in his chair. So Patrick used the next couple hours to add some additional automation that would show just how advanced this new version was. When Joseph awoke the two went over their demonstration once more, and everything worked perfectly. Their gamble had paid off, the new program was extraordinarily resilient to variations in the input file and required minimal user interaction to run. The potential client was wowed by the demonstration, as the product they were shown vastly superior to what they were expecting. As a result, they purchased a liscence for one of their largest build sites to act as a pilot. Joseph stayed in contact with end users and they reported that the application ran without a hitch. The last time ASE was heard of was when an alert was received that users had tried to run the program for a job it had not been liscenced for. Sadly, a new lisence was not purchased, but this alert was a sign to the young creators that their program was actively being used throughout the project. A much larger, better equipped team had once stated that this program was impossible to make, and two college students managed to make it a reality that was appreciated by its users until the end.

### Use Case
Throughout the length of a project, project engineers spend several days or weeks entering and formatting data for panel schedule printing. Once the sheets are initially populated, they must then be manually updated any time any time a change is made to the schedules, which is often dozens of times during the projects lifetime. In addition to this, it is common for mistakes to not be caught until late in the project which can have costly effects. ASE was created to automate this process. ASE is a desktop application that allows PEs to comlete this process in just a few clicks. Project engineers can now format the schedules for an entire job site in under 20 minutes and be confident in knowing no errors were made during the process. When panel schedules are updated, simply enter the updated sheet into ASE and it will generate an updated document in seconds. ASE was designed to be quickly reconfigurable to work with any panel schedule format.
